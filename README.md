# Multiple Linear Regression for RobotCalibration

In this Project, I will illustrate the use of multiple linear regression for calibrating robot control.In addition to reviewing the concepts in themultiple linear regression ,you will see how to use multiple linear regression for time series data -- an importantconcept in dynamical systems such as robotics.The robot data for the lab is taken generously from the TU Dortmund's Multiple Link RobotArms Project(-dortmund.de/cms/en/research/robotics/TUDOR_engl/index.html). As part of the project, they have created an excellent public dataset:MERIt(-dortmund.de/cms/en/research/robotics/TUDOR_engl/index.html#h3MERIt)-- A Multi-Elastic-Link Robot Identification Dataset that can be used for understanding robot dynamics.The data is from a three link robot
